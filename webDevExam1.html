        Japan was settled about 35,000 years ago by Paleolithic people from the Asian mainland. At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a culture called the <dfn>Jomon developed</dfn>. Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels.

            Early Japanese history is traditionally divided into five major eras: the Paleolithic (c. 50,000 BC – c. 12,000BC), Jomon (c.11,000 BC to 300 BC), Yayoi (9,000 BC – 250 AD), Kofun (300 AD – 552 AD) and Yamato Periods (552-710 AD). While the dating of these periods is complex (see accompanying chart) and the cultures in any case tended to overlap, it is clear that early Japan underwent profound changes in each of these important periods.

            Classical Japan
        </h3>
            <blockquote cite="https://geography.name/classical-japan/">
                The Heian period (794&dash;1185) is a critical period of Japanese history. Although the cultural heritage imparted by China and the early Korean states remains a part of Japan, distinct and sophisticated Japanese cultural forms emerged during this period. The new capital city was situated in a nation with an estimated population of 5 million people. Heian, by the millennium, had a population of around 100,000, making it larger than any European city of the time but significantly smaller than the Chinese capital of <em>Chang'an or classical Rome</em>.  Through most of the period, the powerful Fujiwara family successfully exercised ''marriage politics.'' Rather than make the mistake of actually trying to assume the imperial title, the family would marry their daughters to child emperors, and a Fujiwara male aristocrat would be the de facto head of government. As Buddhism continued to be important among the upper classes, emperors would abdicate relatively young—the average age was 31—ostensibly to focus on religious practices. During the Heian period, the imperial family and a few hundred high-ranking aristocrats played a major part in creating aspects of Japanese culture that are still present in contemporary Japan.

        <h4>Feudal Japan</h4>

                Feudal Japan lasted from the years 1185 AD to 1603 AD. During this period in Japan’s history, the shoguns held more power in society than the emperor and the imperial court. In the feudal society, the shoguns handed out land to their loyal followers and these estates were then overseen by different stewards and constables. Japan was not the only country to operate under a feudal system, but theirs was different to the feudalism in Europe.

        <h5>Early Modern Japan</h5>
        <blockquote>
            In the 1550&dash;60 period the <em>Sengoku daimyo</em>, who had survived the wars of the previous 100 years, moved into an even fiercer stage of mutual conflict. These powerful daimyo were harassed not only by each other but also by the rise of common people within their domains. The daimyo sought to resolve their dilemma by acquiring land and people to widen their domains and, finally, by trying to seize control of the whole country. That, of course, required the control of Kyōto, the political centre of Japan since ancient times. Out of these bloody struggles emerged one Sengoku daimyo, Oda Nobunaga of Owari province (in modern Aichi prefecture), who succeeded in occupying the capital as the first feudal unifier.

        <h6>Modern Japan</h6>
        <blockquote>Japan is arguably today's most successful industrial economy, combining almost unprecedented affluence with social stability and apparent harmony. Japanese goods and cultural products are consumed all over the world, ranging from animated movies and computer games all the way through to cars, semiconductors, and management techniques. In many ways, Japan is an icon of the modern world, and yet it remains something of an enigma to many.</blockquote>
