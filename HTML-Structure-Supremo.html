        At its root, simple living is cutting to the fundamentals: a life driven by what’s most important and valuable to you.
        In that sense, material items don’t come to the forefront of the discussion. To live simply, we must first focus on our values and the aspects of our life that are vital to our existence.
        In my opinion, living a simple life means living a life most fulfilling to you because you are investing your time and energy into things that matter the most.
