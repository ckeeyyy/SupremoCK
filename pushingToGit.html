    <p>
    First let's discuss what is git? <br>
    Git is a <dfn>free and open source</dfn> distributed control system designed to handle <br>
    everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        Here are the steps to push your code to your own repository.
    </h2>

    <pre><code>  
        1. Create a folder specifically for your project.  
             $ mkdir <dfn>[yourFolderName]</dfn>
            
            Output:

                <samp>$ mkdir webDevSupremo</samp>

        2. Change directory.
            $ cd <dfn>[yourFolderName]</dfn>

            Output:

                <samp>$ cd webDevSupremo</samp>

        3. Next is to open your VSCode.

        4. Create a new file in VSCode and then put it in the folder that you created (Refer to step #1).
            Ex: pushingToGit.html

        5. Input your code to your html file. 

        6. After coding, push and commit your file through Git Bash. 

        7. Make sure you're in the right directory
            $ pwd

            Output: 

                <samp>/c/Users/SMARTLAB PC 04/webDevSupremo</samp>
        
        8. Make sure you configure your credentials. 
            $ git config --global user@email "MY_NAME@example.com"

        9. Add your remote repository in your local machine
            $ git remote add <dfn>[localComputer] [url to your repository]</dfn>

        10. Make sure you're in the correct branch
            $ git branch -M main

        11. Add all your code to the add phase
            $ git add <dfn>[Name of your file]</dfn>

        12. Check your file using git status 
            $ git status

            Output: 

                <samp>Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

                    Changes to be committed:
                      (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
                            new file:   pushingToGit.html</samp>

        13. Then commit your code to the repository 
            $ git commit -M "Commit code"

        14. Push your code to the repository 
            $ git push -u <dfn>[localComputer] [currentBranch]</dfn>
